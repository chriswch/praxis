# Question Bank

Use this file when you need extra prompts beyond the core workflow in `SKILL.md`. Prefer asking a small batch (3–7) of the highest-leverage questions, then iterate.

## Generic (start here)

**Goal and success**
- What outcome are you trying to achieve (not the solution)?
- What does “success” look like, and how will you measure it?
- What is the definition of done?

**Audience and context**
- Who is this for (users/stakeholders), and what problem are they experiencing?
- What is the current state / baseline today?
- Why now (urgency, deadline, triggering event)?

**Scope**
- What is in scope vs out of scope for this effort?
- What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?

**Constraints**
- What constraints matter (time, budget, platform, policy/compliance, performance, security/privacy)?
- Are there required tools/stack/approvals?

**Examples**
- Can you provide a concrete example (input/output, screenshot, mock, error message, sample doc)?
- Are there “bad outcomes” we must avoid?

## Feature / product

- Who is the primary user persona and their key job-to-be-done?
- What are the primary user flows (happy path) and top edge cases?
- What requirements are functional vs non-functional (latency, accessibility, reliability, privacy)?
- What is the rollout/release expectation (phased, beta, flags, backwards compatibility)?
- What analytics/telemetry is needed to confirm success?
- What existing systems does this touch (dependencies, ownership, constraints)?

## Bug / incident

- What is expected vs actual behavior?
- How can it be reproduced (exact steps), and how often does it happen?
- What environment(s) are affected (OS, browser, device, version, region)?
- What errors/logs/stack traces do you have?
- What changed recently (deploys, config, data, dependencies)?
- What is the impact and severity (users affected, revenue/SLA, data loss, security)?

## Engineering task / refactor

- What is the desired end state (what should be better afterward)?
- What constraints exist (timebox, risk tolerance, required compatibility)?
- What parts must remain stable (APIs, behavior, performance)?
- What tests/verification are required to consider it done?
- What is the migration/rollout plan (if any)?

## Data / analytics

- What decision will this analysis support?
- What metric definitions should be used (exact formula, inclusions/exclusions)?
- What time range and granularity (daily/weekly), segments, and cohorts matter?
- What data sources/tables are in scope, and what are known data quality issues?
- What output format is needed (query, chart, narrative, dashboard)?

## Writing / communication

- Who is the audience and what do they already know?
- What is the goal (inform, persuade, align, decide) and the single key takeaway?
- What constraints exist (length, tone, format, deadline)?
- What inputs must be incorporated (links, notes, quotes), and what must be avoided?

## Integration / API

- What systems are involved and who owns them?
- What is the data model and mapping (fields, types, required/optional)?
- What authentication/authorization model is required?
- What are the failure modes and retry/idempotency expectations?
- What are performance limits (rate limits, payload size, latency)?
